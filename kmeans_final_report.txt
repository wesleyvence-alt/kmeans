K-MEANS CLUSTERING PROJECT – REPORT

1. Dataset Description
The dataset was generated using the make_blobs function from sklearn.datasets.
It contains 300 data points with 2 numerical features. The data was generated
around three natural centers with a cluster standard deviation of 1.2.

2. Objective
The objective of this project is to implement the K-Means clustering algorithm
from scratch using NumPy and validate its correctness by comparing the results
with the sklearn KMeans implementation. Additionally, the Elbow Method is used
to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).

3. Method Used
A custom K-Means algorithm was implemented using NumPy for all core operations.
The algorithm follows the standard K-Means steps:
- Random initialization of centroids
- Distance computation using Euclidean distance
- Cluster assignment
- Centroid update using the mean of assigned points
- Convergence checking using centroid tolerance

4. Elbow Method
The Elbow Method was applied by running the custom K-Means algorithm for
K values ranging from 1 to 10. For each K, the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares
(WCSS) was calculated. The resulting SSE curve showed a clear elbow at K = 3,
indicating that 3 is the optimal number of clusters.

5. Final Result
- Selected K value: 3
- Custom KMeans WCSS: 816.2777536191549
- Sklearn KMeans WCSS: 816.2777536191552

6. Conclusion
The custom K-Means implementation is correct and produces results consistent
with sklearn’s KMeans algorithm. The Elbow Method further justifies the
selection of K = 3 as the optimal number of clusters.

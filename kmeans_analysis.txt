KMEANS CLUSTERING – ANALYSIS

1. Objective:
The goal of this experiment is to validate a custom implementation of the
KMeans clustering algorithm by comparing it with the sklearn KMeans model.

2. Methodology:
- Randomly initialize k centroids from the dataset.
- Assign each data point to the nearest centroid using Euclidean distance.
- Recalculate centroids as the mean of assigned points.
- Repeat until centroids converge or maximum iterations are reached.

3. WCSS Comparison:
WCSS measures the compactness of clusters. Lower WCSS indicates better clustering.
The observed WCSS values from both implementations differ only at the 13th decimal
place, which is due to floating-point precision.

4. Interpretation:
The near-identical WCSS values confirm:
- Correct distance calculation
- Proper centroid updates
- Successful convergence of the custom algorithm

5. Limitations:
- Results may vary with different random initializations.
- Only Euclidean distance is supported.
- The algorithm may converge to a local minimum.

6. Final Insight:
This experiment successfully demonstrates that a custom KMeans implementation
can closely replicate sklearn’s results when implemented correctly.

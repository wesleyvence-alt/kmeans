K-MEANS CLUSTERING PROJECT ANALYSIS

1. Data Generation Analysis
The dataset consists of 300 two-dimensional points generated around three
distinct centers. The distribution ensures natural cluster formation,
making it suitable for evaluating the K-Means algorithm.

2. Algorithm Workflow
The custom K-Means algorithm follows these steps:
- Random selection of initial centroids from the dataset
- Distance computation using Euclidean distance
- Assignment of data points to the nearest centroid
- Centroid recalculation using the mean of assigned points
- Iterative refinement until convergence using a tolerance threshold

3. SSE and Elbow Method Interpretation
SSE measures cluster compactness. A significant drop in SSE is observed up to
K = 3, indicating improved clustering. After K = 3, the decrease in SSE is
comparatively small, suggesting diminishing returns.

4. Justification for K = 3
The dataset was synthetically generated with three centers. The Elbow Method
numerically supports this by showing a clear elbow at K = 3, validating the
selection of the optimal number of clusters.

5. Final Cluster Interpretation
With K = 3, the clusters are compact and well separated. Each cluster
represents one underlying data-generating center, confirming the correctness
of the clustering process.

6. Limitations
- The algorithm is sensitive to initial centroid selection.
- Different initializations may lead to slightly different SSE values.
- Only Euclidean distance is supported.

7. Final Insight
This analysis confirms that the custom NumPy-based K-Means implementation
correctly identifies the underlying cluster structure and successfully
applies the Elbow Method to justify the optimal K.

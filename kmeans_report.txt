K-MEANS CLUSTERING PROJECT REPORT

1. Dataset Information
The dataset was generated using the make_blobs function.
Total samples: 300
Number of features: 2
Cluster standard deviation: 1.2

2. Objective
The objective of this project is to implement the K-Means clustering algorithm
from scratch using NumPy and determine the optimal number of clusters using the
Elbow Method.

3. Elbow Method Results
The algorithm was executed for K values from 1 to 10.
The SSE (WCSS) values obtained are:

K = 1  -> 20729.81
K = 2  -> 6045.98
K = 3  -> 816.28
K = 4  -> 720.05
K = 5  -> 657.31
K = 6  -> 563.42
K = 7  -> 557.16
K = 8  -> 483.57
K = 9  -> 452.42
K = 10 -> 353.21

4. Optimal K Selection
A sharp decrease in SSE is observed from K = 1 to K = 3.
Beyond K = 3, the reduction in SSE becomes gradual.
Therefore, K = 3 is selected as the optimal number of clusters.

5. Final Result
Final WCSS for K = 3: 816.2777536191549

6. Conclusion
The Elbow Method confirms that three clusters best represent the dataset.
The custom K-Means implementation successfully clusters the data and produces
a meaningful and well-separated cluster structure.

KMEANS CLUSTERING – REPORT

Dataset:
- Number of samples: 300
- Number of features: 2
- Data generation method: make_blobs
- Number of clusters (k): 3

Models Used:
1. Custom KMeans implementation (from scratch using NumPy)
2. Scikit-learn KMeans implementation

Results:
- Custom KMeans WCSS : 816.2777536191549
- Sklearn KMeans WCSS: 816.2777536191552

Observation:
The Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) values obtained from both the custom
implementation and the sklearn implementation are almost identical.

Conclusion:
The custom KMeans algorithm is working correctly and produces results that are
numerically consistent with the industry-standard sklearn KMeans algorithm.
